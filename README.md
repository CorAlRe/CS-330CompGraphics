How do I approach designing software?

  I approach software design with an idea, requirements, architecture, implmentation, testing, and publication.

What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?

I've learned 3D graphics, object positioning, texturing, lighting, sound, and collisions.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?

Locating royalty free assets to include in my projects.

How did iteration factor into your development?

Once I finished a feature, before adding the next, I refactored the existing code to make the project more manageable.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?

I learned how to apply geometry and linear algebra's matrices and vectors within a computational environment.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

I really want to be able to display information in a less static flat way. I want to make viewing information a fun and enjoyable experience.
